## 📊 **What You Built**

### 🛡️ **The Unliquidatable Loan Protocol**
- **Problem**: Cross-chain lending fails because bridges are too slow (10-30 minutes) vs liquidation speed (seconds)

- **Innovation**: First protocol to use Reactive Contracts for liquidation prevention

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
```
Origin (Sepolia) → Reactive Network → Destination (Mumbai)
     Vault      →  LendingManager  →    LoanMarket
```
